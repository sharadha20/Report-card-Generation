# Report-card-Generation

Welcome to the **Report Card Generation** project! This C++ project allows you to manage student records and generate report cards based on their academic performance.

## Introduction

The **Report Card Generation** project is designed to help teachers and educators manage student records and generate report cards with ease. The project uses C++ to provide a user-friendly interface for various operations, including creating student records, displaying student details, modifying records, and generating report cards.

## Technologies Used

- C++ Programming Language
- File Handling (Input/Output Streams)
- Console Input/Output
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

## Features

- Create new student records by entering student details.
- Display all student records along with their academic information.
- Search for a specific student record by roll number.
- Modify student records to update information.
- Delete student records as needed.
- Generate report cards with calculated grades and percentages.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++ for Unix-like systems, Turbo C++ for Windows).
2. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
3. Compile the project source code using your C++ compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable to start the application.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the project's features.

## Project Structure

- `student.h`: Header file containing the `student` class definition.
- `main.cpp`: Main source code file containing the program's entry point and functions.
